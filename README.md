# CPU_Simulator
A CPU simulator is a software tool used to simulate the operations of a computer's central processing unit (CPU). It allows users to understand how the CPU works by providing a visual representation of the CPU's internal operations and how it interacts with other components of the computer, such as memory and input/output devices.
